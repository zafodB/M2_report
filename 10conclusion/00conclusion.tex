% A number of challenges arose when working on the project. The most fundamental challenge was to understand how \acrshort{acs} works, to identify its main components and to learn about the current systems. Once the knowledge is acquired, the selection of right technologies was an important aspect, as there exists many technologies and standards which can be implemented in the proposed system and therefore, finding the most suitable one was of a big importance. This goes hand in hand with designing a systemâ€™s architecture from the scratch and figuring out how the chosen components and technologies can be interconnected to perform desired tasks, while keeping in mind the security and easiness of use.
