\subsection{Authentication} \label{authentication_sota}
Authentication is the process of confirming and verifying someone's identity. In this section, we consider \acrlong{oidc} and FIDO as the two main technologies that can be used for online authentication. Afterwards, the \acrshort{nist} framework is presented, as it defines a useful classification model for authentication procedures, based on their security level.
