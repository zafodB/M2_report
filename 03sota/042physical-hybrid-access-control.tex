\subsubsection{Physical and hybrid access control -- HID Global} \label{sec:pacs-hid}

For the physical and hybrid access control, HID\footnote{\url{https://www.hidglobal.com/}, accessed 02 April 2019} is chosen with its HID Mobile access and Extended Access solutions. HID is one of the leading companies~\cite{TopManufacturers} on the market offering access controls, identity management or \acrshort{iot} solutions. Targeting mostly enterprises with the offer of the whole package, including software and hardware, tailored for the need of an enterprise. Both technologies we cover are designed and implemented based on enterprise’s needs. Because of that, no detailed documentation explaining the working of the system and its technologies is available. The following is a summary of what HID can offer with their system, which may be relevant for our proposed system.

\paragraph{HID Mobile Access}
Mobile Access by HID\footnote{\url{https://www.hidglobal.com/solutions/hid-mobile-access-solutions}, accessed 02 April 2019} is a physical access solution for enterprises, which replaces, or supplements access cards. The solution focuses mostly on the physical access, where mobile devices such as smartphones, wearables or tablets can be used for authentication and granting the access. \acrshort{ble} and \acrshort{nfc} is used~\cite{HIDGlobal2014HIDGlobal} for communication with a mobile-enabled readers. Devices with different operating systems (Android, iOS, BlackBerry) are supported as long as they are \acrshort{nfc} or \acrshort{ble} enabled. When accessing the premises, two modes of communication with a reader are offered: 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textit{Twist\&Go} - where a device can be a few meters from a reader and has to be twisted to begin authentication (utilising \acrshort{ble}),
    \item \textit{Tap\&Go} - where the device has to be swiped over a reader to be authenticated (using \acrshort{nfc}).
\end{enumerate*}
%
HID Secure Identity Service is used for managing employees’ Mobile \acrshort{id}s. Once a Mobile \acrshort{id} is created in the system, the employee receives an invitation with access codes, downloads the application, enrols into it and starts using it without further dues. As the case study at Netflix showed~\cite{2012NetflixPilot}, employees find mobile access intuitive and 90\% of surveyed employees found it easy to use.

\paragraph{Extended Access}
HID offers an Extended Access Technologies\footnote{\url{ https://www.hidglobal.com/extended-access-technologies}, accessed 02 April 2019} besides their physical access. The idea behind is to use the same credentials and an `authenticator' throughout the enterprise during the day, instead of several, which is more convenient for the employee and offers a wider range of applications for the enterprise. It also offers the policy management endpoint from which the accesses are managed. A Trusted Identity~\cite{2018ExperiencingPredictive} is used, which means that an employee’s ‘authenticator’ is verified once and can be used freely afterwards. This Trusted Identity can be built into smartcards, wearables or a smartphone application, allowing the use of printers, payment at the canteen, booking of meeting rooms, accessing premises, etc. All with a single device that has been once verified. In the case of a smartphone application and for physical access to premises, every single employee can be individually identified, even if a crowd is moving through a door. In case of higher security measures, multi-factor authentication can be enabled and biometrics or \acrshort{pin} can be used. On top of that, the system provides advanced predictive analytics for better optimisation of a work place. 
% Unfortunately, no additional information is shared by HID publicly, besides brochures, and therefore, we cannot look into what technologies they are using. The only obvious technologies are \acrshort{ble} and \acrshort{nfc}.
