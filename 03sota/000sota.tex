\section{State of the Art} \label{sec:sota}

In this chapter we consider two existing solutions for online and physical access control that are currently available on the market. We then introduce basic terms related to the access control. Based on the existing solutions we explore some of the underlying technologies that are relevant for the access control problem and we introduce them in three broad categories -- Authentication, Authorisation and Access Policy Management.
