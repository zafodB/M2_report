\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

Once all the requirements of the system were laid down, the implementation phase could commence. In the following chapter the implementation of selected Use cases and requirements is described. The system is implemented as two separate segments: Authentication -- exposing the FIDO2 flow and the use of an authenticator, and Authorisation -- demonstrating the OAuth flow.

\input{06implementation/02OAuth.tex}

In this chapter, the implementation of the prototype is described in two parts: Authentication and Authorisation. The setup, technologies and libraries are explained, followed by the overview of implemented system flows. Lastly, the testing methods are mentioned briefly. 

The Authentication part of the prototype is fully implemented, fulfilling the use cases and requirements set to be implemented. The second part, Authorisation, does not implement the use cases and requirements in full-scale, while it still demonstrates the flows and use of tokens in OAuth.
