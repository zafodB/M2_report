\acrfull{acs} plays a crucial role in every enterprise. They are used for both the physical access to company premises, online, and internal resources. There are countless of different systems and providers, with offerings ranging from simple access-card-based systems, password-based log-in screens to complex systems combining different types of physical and online access to resources. 

The problem of today’s access systems is that they are usually handling physical and online accesses separately. Two systems must be implemented and maintained, and companies usually only specialise in providing one of those systems. Companies such as HID\footnote{\url{https://www.hidglobal.com/solutions/access-control-systems}, accessed 26 March 2019} or G4S\footnote{\url{https://www.g4s.com/en-gb/what-we-do/security-services/fire-and-security-systems/symmetry-software}, accessed 26 March 2019} are providing physical \acrshort{acs} to enterprises which allows employees to access the building, rooms, canteen, or garage, based on their access level. On the other side of the spectrum, there are tech companies such as Microsoft\footnote{\url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview}, accessed 26 March 2019} which offer software for managing employees’ access to online services and resources.

Therefore, there exist two mostly independent systems intended for similar use cases. These systems are either managed individually or can be interconnected, so that there is one endpoint for managing accesses. Both approaches work fine, but what if there was an \acrshort{acs} which would combine both physical and online access? What if physical access would be possible by authenticating the employee with smartcard, smartphone or authenticator key? Simply, there would only be a need for one device, with which an employee would be able to access premises, as well as authenticate themselves when logging-in to an online service. Such a system does not only solve the problem of the employees’ experience and convenience of having to carry around an access card, but also a problem of security of corporate account because of passwords. The reason is that many companies have policies that require a change of password a few times a year and therefore, employees tend to use easy to remember passwords. Furthermore, many corporate accounts have been compromised by phishing attacks\cite{Kessem2017CanadianAttacks}. This can be avoided by using physical authenticators instead of passwords.

The aim of this project is to address this problem and propose a system, where physical access control and online access control is managed from a single system. Another very important feature introduced by this system, is the possibility of using \acrshort{fido}2 authenticator with \acrshort{nfc}, or a smartphone to access a building, rooms or printers. Both devices would work similarly to an access card which is usually given to an employee on their first day. It is common these days, that employees sign in to many online services with their corporate account. To avoid passwords, \acrshort{fido}2 can be used for authentication when logging in to an account, by using an authenticator -- either a physical key device or a smartphone. This allows for \textit{strong authentication}~\cite{McDowell2017WhyAlliance}. The only thing the employee needs to type in during logging in is their user ID. They are afterwards authenticated, if they can demonstrate the possession of a \acrshort{fido}2 authenticator. The access card is therefore replaced by an authenticator (which can also be smartphone-based) and the employee does no longer need to remember a password.

Secondary aim of this system lies in the access management, which grants or denies the entry or use of a service for an employee. To facilitate this, policies, attributes or role-based access can be implemented, which enable automated, fine-grained access control.

% assigning to each employee a role/s and  attributes or creating policies by which the access will be granted or denied automatically.
