\subsection{Report Structure}

In this project, we begin by explaining our development process and some of the methods and tools we use in Chapter~\ref{sec:methodology}. We then examine existing solutions and technologies in Chapter~\ref{sec:sota}. Detailed analysis of the problem follows and use cases and requirements are used to describe the proposed system in Chapter~\ref{sec:analysis}. Selected use cases are elaborated on and a detailed system architecture is outlined in Chapter~\ref{sec:design}. Chapter~\ref{sec:implementation} documents the implementation of the two parts of the prototype. The findings, contributions and future perspectives are discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:discussion} and the project is concluded in Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}. List of used acronyms and abbreviations is available in the beginning of the report. There are three appendixes.
