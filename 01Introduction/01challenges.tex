There is a number of challenges, which the current \acrshort{acs} in enterprises are facing. One of the major concerns of every access system is its security. Passwords are often targeted as the weakest link in the system. Every employee has their corporate account linked with many services and is accessing many protected resources. Often employees are forced to change their passwords periodically. Therefore, choosing a weak password and successful phishing attacks are a threat which is usually being solved by two-factor authentication, but as recent studies shows

Often, the physical access control and access policy management systems are two separate entities in enterprises. This requires more resources spend on managing these systems, as well as more set-up work when a new employee is hired or leaves the company. Having one system to handle these tasks is thus desirable.
