\subsection{Challenges} \label{challenges}

There is a number of challenges which current \acrlong{acs} and enterprises are facing. One of the major concerns of every access system is its security, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The weakest link we identified are passwords. Every employee has it corporate account linked with many services and is accessing many protected resources. Often employees are forced to change their passwords periodically. Therefore, choosing a weak password and successful phishing attacks are a threat which is usually being solved by two-factor authentication, but as recent studies shows (REF!) its not enough. Stopping the use of passwords is one of ways of improving security.

Living in the era of fast technical advance, employees also require convenience when using access systems and carrying around an access card is not seen anymore as a convenient way of authenticating an employee (REF!). \acrshort{acs} should therefore, offer more convenient ways of authentication.

Often, the physical access control and access policy management systems are two separate entities in enterprises. This requires more resources to keep them administrated as well as more time when employing a new employee or making changes. Having one endpoint from which both systems can be managed is thus desirable.
