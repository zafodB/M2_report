    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Pre-conditions}&
    \textbullet~Employee has an enterprise digital identity assigned. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee has previously registered at least one of the following authenticators: \newline
    \textit{i)} single-factor \acrshort{fido} physical key with acrshort{usb} or \acrshort{nfc}, \newline
    \textit{ii)} \acrshort{fido} enabled smartphone. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee is in control of the previously registered authenticator. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee does not have an active session with the given client on the given device.\newline
    \textbullet~Policies have been set up that authorise the employee to access the client.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Processing}& 
    \textbullet~Employee launches the client application (either natively on the platform or in a web-browser). \newline
    \textopenbullet The client can be either internal system or external system. The sign-in process of the employee is the same in both cases. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee clicks on \textit{Sign-in}, \textit{Log-in} or similar button, or is redirected to sign-in automatically. A sign-in form appears. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee enters their \acrlong{uid}. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee is prompted to select their preferred authentication method: a physical key or a smartphone.
    \newline
    \textopenbullet~If physical key is selected, the employee is prompted to use their key with their device (depending on the make of the key and the device). \newline
    \textopenbullet~If a smartphone is selected, the employee is prompted to navigate to a predefined website (enterprise-supplied authentication front end) on their smartphone, where they are prompted to authenticate with FIDO on their smartphone. \newline
    \textbullet~Once the employee has been successfully authenticated, their attributes are checked against the existing policies for the system and the authorisation to access the system is verified.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Outcome}& 
    \textbullet~Employee signed-in and may begin to use the system, or\newline
    \textbullet~Employee is denied to access the system because they could not be authenticated or are authorised to access the given system.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Post-conditions}&
    \textbullet~A session is created between employee's device and the system. Depending on the security settings, the employee might need to sign in the next time when they use the system.
