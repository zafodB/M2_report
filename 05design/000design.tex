\section{System Design}\label{sec:design}

The technologies and requirements identified previously are used in this chapter to design and propose a solution to the access control problem. First, the entities required to implement the system are listed. Due to resource limitations of this project, not all of the use cases that constitute the \acrshort{mvp} can be implemented. Instead, a subset of the use cases is selected to be implemented in the experimental prototype. These use cases are elaborated on in detail. Toward the end of this chapter, the system flows during authentication, policy evaluation and policy enforcement are described using sequence diagrams.
