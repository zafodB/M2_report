\subsection{Prototype Requirements}\label{sec:design-prototype-requirements}

Based on the use cases highlighted in the previous section, we describe the requirements necessary to implement these use cases. Naturally, all requirements linked with given use cases should be implemented. The following requirements are linked to the selected use cases: RQ-1, RQ-2, RQ3, RQ-4, RQ-5, RQ-18 and RQ-19. These requirements are selected to be implemented in the prototype and drive the design choices behind the system architecture.
