\section{System Design}

In the previous chapter we focus on the system as a deployable \acrlong{mvp}. However, for the purpose of this project, we only implement a part of this \acrshort{mvp} to demonstrate the concept functionality -- we implement a prototype. The prototype demonstrates, how a FIDO key is used in the system to Authenticate a user and how this information is relayed to an external system to sign the user in. This chapter explains in more details selected use cases and requirements. It then continues to describe the components of the prototype and high-level system flows.


% The main focus of this project and the very basis of the system is Authentication and Authorisation. One can argue that Access policy management is an integral part of the system, with which we agree, but for the purposes of the prototype this can be hardcoded and focus can be put upon implementation of Authentication and Authorisation components of the system which utilises \acrshort{fido}2 technology and \acrlong{oidc} +  OAuth standards. Therefore, the prototype will demonstrate employee's sign-in to external client system and opening of doors.

% In this section, the prototype to be implemented is described. Followed by the detail explanation of Use cases and Requirements associated with the prototype. This section further analyse the entities of the proposed system and their roles. Afterwards, we present high-level sequence diagrams of the system for the basic use cases. We explain what messages flow among the system components and how these represent the individual authentication and authorisation flows explained in the \href{sec:analysis}{Analysis section}.
