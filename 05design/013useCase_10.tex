    UC-17: Access user's protected resources 
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Description}&
    External systems might need to read or modify user's protected resources, such as files, emails, calendar entries, or others, to fulfil their function.

    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Primary actors}&
    \textbullet~External client

    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Secondary actors}&
    None
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Pre-conditions}&
    \textbullet~A client connection between the external system and the \acrshort{acs} has been established. \newline
    \textbullet~The policy permits the access to the protected resources.\newline
    \textbullet~The user has previously signed in to the external system.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Processing}&
    \textbullet~The \acrshort{acs} verifies that the external system has been registered.\newline
    \textbullet~The \acrshort{acs} verifies that the user is signed in or has previously singed in to the external system.\newline
    \textbullet~The \acrshort{acs} verifies that the policy permits the external system to access user's protected resources.\newline
    \textbullet~If the previous conditions are met, the \acrshort{acs} issues an access token to the External client. The external client uses this token when querying the system for user's resources. The validity of the token is time bound and can be only used to request resources about the user it has been issued for.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Outcome}&
    \textbullet~The external system can read or modify user's resources, after it has successfully presented a valid access token; or \newline
    \textbullet~Access was denied and the external system cannot manipulate user's protected resources.
    \\
    \hline
     \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Post-conditions}&
     \textbullet~The access token cannot be used for other user's resources, or after it's validity has expired.
