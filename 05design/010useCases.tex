\subsection{Prototype Use Cases} \label{sec:design-prototype-usecases}
To demonstrate the functionality of the proposed \acrshort{acs} in practice, we select the most common uses of our system: signing in, passing a checkpoint and accessing a protected resource. These are represented by UC-1, UC-2, and UC-16 and are discussed further.

UC-1 and UC-2 include the authentication flow with FIDO, which is not used widely today in the combination of Online and \acrlong{pacs}, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:analysis-authentication}. UC-16 (generalisation of UC-17 and UC-18) complements the sign-in process by providing information about the user and serving the protected resources to the client. These are essentially the use cases that an employee would encounter on a daily basis. The remaining use cases are more administrative and are not necessary to demonstrate the intended system functionality, therefore they are not discussed further.

On the following pages, detailed description of the use cases is provided for UC-1 (Table~\ref{tab:useCase_01}), UC-2 (Table~\ref{tab:useCase_02}), UC-17 (Table~\ref{tab:useCase_10}) and UC-18 (Table~\ref{tab:usecase-18-specs}).
