        \item Employee clicks on \textit{Sign-in}, \textit{Log-in} or similar button, or is redirected to sign-in automatically. A sign-in form appears.
        \item Employee enters their \acrlong{uid}.
        \item Employee is prompted to select their preferred authentication method: a physical key or a smartphone. If a physical key is selected, the employee is prompted to use their key with their device (depending on the make of the key and the device). If a smartphone is selected, the employee is prompted to navigate to a predefined website (enterprise-supplied authentication front end) on their smartphone, where they are prompted to authenticate with FIDO.
        \item Once the employee has been successfully authenticated, their attributes are checked against the existing policies for the system and the authorisation to access the system is verified.\vspace*{-\baselineskip}
