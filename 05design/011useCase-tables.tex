    \textbullet~Employee has an enterprise digital identity assigned. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee has previously registered at least one of the following authenticators: \newline
    \textit{i)} single-factor \acrshort{fido} physical key with \acrshort{usb} or \acrshort{nfc}, \newline
    \textit{ii)} \acrshort{fido} enabled smartphone. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee is in control of the previously registered authenticator. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee does not have an active session with the given client on the given device.\newline
    \textbullet~Policies have been set up that authorise the employee to access the client.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Processing}& 
    \textbullet~Employee launches the client application (either natively on the platform or in a web-browser). \newline
    \textopenbullet The client can be either internal system or external system. The sign-in process of the employee is the same in both cases. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee clicks on \textit{Sign-in}, \textit{Log-in} or similar button, or is redirected to sign-in automatically. A sign-in form appears. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee enters their \acrlong{uid}. \newline
    \textbullet~Employee is prompted to select their preferred authentication method: a physical key or a smartphone.
    \newline
    \textopenbullet~If a physical key is selected, the employee is prompted to use their key with their device (depending on the make of the key and the device). \newline
    \textopenbullet~If a smartphone is selected, the employee is prompted to navigate to a predefined website (enterprise-supplied authentication front end) on their smartphone, where they are prompted to authenticate with FIDO. \newline
    \textbullet~Once the employee has been successfully authenticated, their attributes are checked against the existing policies for the system and the authorisation to access the system is verified.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Outcome}& 
    \textbullet~Employee signed-in and may begin to use the system, or\newline
    \textbullet~Employee is denied to access the system because they could not be authenticated or are not authorised to access the given system.
    \\
    \hline
    \cellcolor[HTML]{CBCEFB}\textbf{Post-conditions}&
    \textbullet~A session is created between employee's device and the system. Depending on the security settings, the employee might not need to sign in the next time when they use the system.

    \textbullet~Employee indicates at the reader device that they wish to use smartphone to identify and authenticate themselves.

    \textbullet~The \acrshort{acs} verifies that the policy permits the external system to access user's protected resources.\newline
    \textbullet~If the previous conditions are met, the \acrshort{acs} issues an access token to the External client.
