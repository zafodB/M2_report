\subsection{Requirements}
System Requirements specification is \textit{``a structured collection of information that embodies the requirements of the system''}~\cite{ISO2010ISO/IEC/Vocabulary}. There are two types  of requirements: 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Functional requirements - \textit{``specifies a function that a system or system component must be able
to perform''}~\cite{ISO2010ISO/IEC/Vocabulary}
    \item Non-functional requirements - \textit{``a software requirement that describes not what the software will do, but how the software will do it''}~\cite{ISO2010ISO/IEC/Vocabulary}.
\end{itemize}

By specifying system requirements, both functional and non-functional ones, we are able to define system's functionality and performance metrics, so when system design phase begins, it is clear what a system must fulfil in order to perform reliably and satisfactory.
