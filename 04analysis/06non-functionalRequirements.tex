\subsubsection{Non-functional requirements} \label{sec:analysis-nonfunctional}
Non-functional requirements describe how the system is and how does it perform. They can be evaluated based on measures. User usually cannot directly see their implementation, but can rather feel it by the system performance. Often they influence the architecture of the system. Table~\ref{tab:nonfunctional-requirements} lists these requirements for the proposed system. The \textit{Reference} column indicates the origin of the given requirement to map, why that requirement has been included.
