\subsection{Requirements} \label{sec:analysis-requirements}
The following section describes the requirements of the proposed system. The requirements have been derived based on the analysis in previous sections of this chapter. Two kinds of requirements are presented -- the functional requirements and non-functional requirements. 

The requirements listed here are proposed as the minimal necessary requirements for the deployment of the system into production (\acrlong{mvp}). As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:analysis-usecases}, a fully mature system could introduce many more functional requirements, however these are not listed here. Because all the listed requirements are necessary for the operation of the system, they all should be implemented in an \acrshort{mvp} and therefore no prioritisation method is used. The additional possible functionalities of the system are discussed in Discussion (Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, p.~\pageref{sec:discussion}).

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements} \label{sec:analysis-functionalReqruiements}
Functional requirements describe what does the system do and which features does it have. Table~\ref{tab:functional-requirements} (p.~\pageref{tab:functional-requirements}) lists these requirements for the proposed system. The \textit{Reference} column indicates the origin of the given requirement to map, why that requirement has been included.
