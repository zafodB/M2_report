\subsubsection*{FIDO considerations}
Shortly before this project was submitted, support of FIDO was announced by Windows as another major operating system, following Android~\cite{Mehta2019WindowsPasswordless}. This is a clear sign of growing support of password-less login scenarios. While both mobile and desktop devices included support for biometric sign-in to the OS for a number of year, this technology was not typically used outside the OS login and to log in to a limited number of native applications that implemented the OS specific libraries for integration with the biometric devices on the device.

FIDO2 helps by removing the need for direct OS integration by exposing the CTAP2 protocol to any interested party via Webauthn. While FIDO2 in itself is not directed at biometric authentication, it brings forward an important abstraction layer to enable secure, yet convenient password-less log-in experience, whether the authenticator is a physical cryptographic key, or the device itself with integrated biometric capabilities. This abstraction can be exploited in the proposed system as well, at least for authenticating to an Online Access Control System.
