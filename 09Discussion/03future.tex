\subsubsection*{Future works}
As described in the beginning of this chapter, further work is needed to implement the envisioned the prototype and to fully implement the proposed system. Existing work on physical access control solutions with a smartphone should be reviewed in greater detail, before implementing this part of the system in practice. 

As new platforms announce support for FIDO2, the system flows should be redesigned to provide native support for this development, which could potentially simplify some of the authentication flows. Similarly, the implementation will be possible with less effort as the libraries mature and common practices are established around the specifications.

With further development of the system, more use cases have to be thought of, as as of now for the \acrshort{mvp}, only the most essential ones are considered. During the development we already came across a few use cases which would be desirable to have implemented in the future. Considering a temporary employee, such as intern, or an external company employee working remotely, such as consultant, are an example. In those cases there might be a need to divert from the passwordless operation of the user's account to save cost.
