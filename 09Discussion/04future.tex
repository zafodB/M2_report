\subsubsection*{Future works}
As described in the beginning of this chapter, further work is needed to implement the envisioned the prototype and to fully implement the proposed system. Existing work on physical access control solutions with a smartphone should be reviewed in greater detail, before implementing this part of the system in practice. 

As new platforms announce support for FIDO2, the system flows should be redesigned to provide native support for this development, which could potentially simplify some of the authentication flows. Similarly, the implementation will be possible with less effort as the libraries mature and common practices are established around the specifications.

With further development of the system, additional use cases would likely have to be derived, to complement the minimal functionality of the proposed \acrshort{mvp}. During the development, several of such use cases were discovered, for example external employee, who needs access to the enterprise internal resources. In such case the system would need to be adapted to support identity federation across enterprises.
