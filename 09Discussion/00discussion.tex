FROM CHALLENGES

A number of challenges exist that will be faced in the project. The most fundamental challenge is to understand how \acrshort{ams} works, to identify its main components and to learn about the current systems. Once the knowledge is acquired, the selection of right technologies is an important aspect, as there exist many technologies and standards which can be implemented in the proposed system and therefore, finding the most suitable one is of a big importance. This goes hand in hand with designing a systemâ€™s architecture from the scratch and figuring out how the chosen components and technologies can be interconnected to perform desired tasks, while keeping in mind the security and easiness of use.

After successfully creating an architecture and choosing the right technologies, the biggest challenges starts, the implementation. In order to develop a minimum viable product/prototype XYZ, the most important components of the system have to be implemented, which requires a very good knowledge of every technology. Subsequently, a documentation of this implementation needs to be provided and decisions made during the process explained.
